					<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
					<div id="profile-image"></div>
					<p>Hi, my name is Matt Jett (if you havn't guessed already)! Let me tell you alittle about myself.</p>
					<p>I'm a junior computer science major at <abbr title="Eastern Washington University">EWU</abbr>. I want to focus on adaptive and responsive design and development of software applications across a wide range of web enabled devices all cloud and <abbr title="Internet of Things">IOT</abbr> connected. I believe learning UX/UI design is a fundamental and essential piece of understanding how to make a successful application in this highly competitive market of computer development.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, I am currently an untraditional student at 31 years old, coming from my past career job as a federal <abbr title="Transportation Security Officer">TSA</abbr> officer for the <abbr title="Department of Homeland Security">DHS</abbr>. Before that I worked as an electronics salesman for most of my post high school life, mastering product knowledge from TV's to laptops and about every electronic in between.</p>
                    <p>I'm finally going to college to change my life around and do something I have always wanted to do--to create and innovate. I have a huge imagination, passion for the arts, and love to write. I have a bunch of future stories in the works, ranging from short stories, novels, to screenplays for films or shows. One day, I hope to make something of these.</p>
                    <p>Recently I got married to my beautiful wife Jenica Jett, took her last name, had open heart surgery, and my son was born all in one year of my life. My son's name is August Jett and he is heartstoppingly cute. I couldn't be happier in life nor more proud.</p>

			<section id="where">
				<h2>Where to Now?</h2>
				<p>I want to focus on the world of mobile, web, and cloud connected applications that are not only responsive to screen size, but contextually aware of its enviroment, adapting its <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> to the platform its being run on.</p>
				<p>What I mean by this, is I want to build full-sized programs that can run on any platform or device auto-adapting its interface from a touch-screen enviroment to a large screen desktop with peripherals attached.</p>
				<p>Hopefully, one day I can create a startup, creating custom software and bringing something new to the world.</p>
				<p>Until then, first things first, graduate...</p>
